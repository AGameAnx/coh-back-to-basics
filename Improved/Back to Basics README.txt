Installation instructions:
  
  1. Extract all files from the .rar archive that you downloaded to your main Company of Heroes
       folder (usually this is at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Company of Heroes).
  
  2. Launch the Mod by using the provided shortcut called Back to Basics.
  
Uninstall instructions:

  To uninstall, simply remove all files you extracted into the Company of Heroes folder from
    this archive. The list of files extracted to the main folder is as follows:
    
    Improved (folder)
    Improved.module
    ImprovedDLC1.module
    ImprovedDLC2.module
    ImprovedDLC3.module
    ImprovedOPS.module

Additional installation notes:
  
  * To create your own steam shortcut:
    
    1. Make a shortcut of the game using steam
    
    2. Go to shotcut's properties (right click it, choose properties)
    
    3. Go to Shortcut menu in shortcut's properties
    
    4. Add //-mod Improved -dev to the end of the Target line. The entire target line should look like this:
       
         steam://rungameid/228200//-mod Improved -dev
  
  * To create a shortcut that doesn't show a prompt when launching the mod
    
    1. Go to your steam install directory (for example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam)
    
    2. Make a shortcut of Steam.exe
    
    3. (optional) Move the shortcut to your desktop, change its icon. A special mod icon can be located in Improved folder of the mod.
    
    4. In shortcut properties add -applaunch 228200 -mod Improved -dev to the target line. The result should look something like this:
    
         "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe" -applaunch 228200 -mod Improved -dev
  
  * If you would like to be able to play any campaign mission without playing through all the
    campaign again, use a shortcut command -unlock_all_missions (add to shortcut target line)
  
  * Additional target line parameters include -novsync and -nomovies which disable game vsync (increases game's responsiveness and FPS) and into movies respectively.

Tips about gameplay:
  
  1. Units in cover take much less damage and suppression than units in the open. The usage of cover is therefore vital in battle.
  2. Short range weapons, like Submachine Guns and Assault Rifles, are best used aggressively, forcing the enemy into close combat.
  3. It is much cheaper to reinforce squads than to deploy a new one. Retreat your units in time to avoid taking unnecessary losses.
  4. Clumped up Infantry squads receive penalty modifiers. Make sure to spread out your Infantry squads to maximize their effectiveness.
  5. Read the descriptions of Officer units carefully, to get to know what they're best used for.
  6. Use smoke intelligently. Smoke can screen units from fire, offering excellent cover and protection against suppression.
  7. Mines are excellent for protecting open flanks, and are excellent at disabling enemy advances which aren't supported by minesweepers.
  8. Unlike the standard Company of Heroes, Strategic Points generate manpower, making them just as viable as Munition or Fuel Points.
  9. Use sight ranges wisely. Engagements can happen at longs distances. Stopping your units to increase their sight range or using jeeps and bikes can be vital to altering outcomes of battles.
  10. Manage your army composition wisely. Infantry will have a high manpower upkeep and most vehicles and even some emplacements drain your fuel income.
  11. Chosing a proper Commander Tree progression is vital. Keep in mind that you aren't required to pick one right away and explore all the possibilities, as you'll find much diversity available.
  12. Most of the upgrades can only be purchased near Base Structures, Forward Barracks or supply providing vehicles such as the Supply Halftrack.
  13. Barraging with Artillery costs a lot of munitions. Make sure to secure a stable munition income and position your barrages wisely.
  14. Denying munition income can be a viable way of preventing your enemy from using Artillery Barrages and other Abilities against you.
