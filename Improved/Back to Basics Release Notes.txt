Back to Basics v4.0
-------------------------------------------------------------

Global Balance Changes:
- Significant changes made to tank, antitank and infantry antitank scatter. Ballistic weapon misses will look more realistic as opposed to firing far off target when the shot misses.
- Significant fixes made to area of effect damage related to area of effect "accuracy". Previously there was a potential to not apply area of effect damage even on minimum radius. Area of effect will now always be applied correctly.
- Area of effect damage and penetration profiles tuned down to make area of effect weapon effectiveness work as intended after the area of effect "accuracy" fix.
- Tank area of effect profiles redone to make them less reliant on direct impacts and more on area of effect damage. This is also a change that works because and is highly related to scatter changes.
- Anti-blob radius decreased from 10 to 6. The radius worked differently than originally expected, creating a bigger aura than intended.
- Anti-blob should no longer affect squads who are inside of buildings, bunkers and halftracks. This does not include trenches.
- Anti-Blob rebalanced; it gives a received suppression of 1.1, received accuracy of 1.02 and weapon accuracy of 0.925.
- Significantly increased light cover effectiveness.
- Slightly increased heavy cover effectiveness.
- Starting resources increased.
- Manpower income from HQs decreased.
- Income from manpower points significantly decreased.
- Removed manpower income from munition and fuel points.
- Victory Point Control possibilities changed from 250/500/1000 to 500/650/800.
- Fuel and Munition strategic point capture time redone:
 * High 40s/35s -> 25s/20s
 * Medium 30s/25s -> 20s/15s
 * Low 20s/15s -> 15s/10s
- Manpower strategic point revert time reduced from 15s to 10s
- Mortar area of effect profile changes increasing their consistency:
 * Reduced lethal range AoE damage radius.
 * Reduced medium range AoE damage and radius.
 * Increased maximum range AoE damage and radius.
- Mortar Shell trajectory slightly improved.
- Mortar effectiveness against bunkers doubled.
- Heavy machine gun effectiveness vs suppressed units reduced.
- Heavy machine gun teardown and setup times reduced.
- Bolt-action and semi-automatic rifle range decreased from 53 to 42, and range table adjusted to 9/20/30/40.
- Sub machine gun and assault rifle range table adjusted to 5/15/23/32.
- Moving accuracy penalty of all small arms weapons decreased and normalized from 0.3-0.75 to 0.8.
- Normalized min/max small arms damage. We felt that damage was too inconsistent, creating for very random performance of most weapons. Weapons should feel much more reliable in their prefered combat situations.
- Sniper rifle range decreased from 63 to 48, and increased the cooldown between each shot from 8.5 to 9 seconds. Sniper Spam was a serious problem when playing pvp - being too cost-effective and too easily capable of hardcountering any infantry squad, Sniper Rifles have seen a decrease in rate of fire and now require to be closer to the action.
- Units that have a camouflage ability will no longer receive a movement buff during camouflage once achieving a certain veterancy rank.
- Fixed the range tables of all 20mm guns, to fall in line with the regular standard; the old range tables made the weapons unintendedly inconsistent on certain ranges. Now there is a consistent damage drop off on larger ranges.
- Maximum population cap for all armies is now set to 125.
- Base population cap for all armies increased by 10.
- Demolition charges recharge time increased from 10 to 25 seconds.
- Demolition charges munition cost decreased from 50 to 35. Due to the nature of Demolition Charges being difficult to use, there was no reason the cost was so steep.
- Demolition charges damage multiplier against all building types increased from 1 to 1.5.
- Goliath damage and area of effect tables equalized to demolition charges.
- Hand-held infantry anti-tank weapons (Panzerschreck, M9 bazooka, M18 recoilless rifle and PIAT) target tables normalized.
- Hand-held infantry anti-tank weapon reloading times standardized: Panzerschreck, bazooka and recoilless rifle reload now takes 8 seconds and PIAT reloads 7 seconds.
- Reworked fuel upkeep to the values that were intended:
 * King Tiger fuel upkeep increased from 0 to 6 per minute.
 * Tiger fuel upkeep increased from 0 to 5 per minute.
 * Panther, Jagdpanther, Churchill and M26 Pershing fuel upkeep increased from 0 to 4 per minute.

 * M10 Wolverine, M36 Jackson, M18 Hellcat, Marder III, Geschützwagen and Nashorn fuel upkeep increased from 0 to 2 per minute.
 * M8 Greyhound, Sd.Kfz. 234 Puma, Hotckiss, Armored Car, Reconnaissance Halftrack, T17, Staghound, Kangaroo, Tetrach and Stuart fuel upkeep increased from 0 to 1 per minute.
- Weapon crews inside emplacements received damage decreased by 50%.
- Grenade recharge time increased from 15 to 20 seconds.
- Grenade throwing range decreased from 25 to 20. The reason behind this is that it was too easy to use grenades in all situations, decreasing the effect of cover and defensive positions.
- Fixed a bug where some grenade types would not be thrown at the combat slots of buildings; making them unreliable against larger building types.
- Most infantry abilities can no longer be used once the squad is pinned, exceptions are for example Fire-Up, Assault and Sprint.
- Medic Station Medics health decreased from 142 to 110.
- Heroic Infantry armor now decreases received suppression by 20% as opposed to 50%.
- Completely reworked critical hits to tanks:

  #100-40% hitpoints: 100% none
  #40-5% hitpoints: 40% none 42% engine damage 10% detrack 8% gun damage
  #5-0% hitpoints: 75% vehicle destroyed 25% out of control
 *Rear Armor Hits:
  #100-40% hitpoints: 90% none 10% engine damage
  #40-5% hitpoints: 20% none 50% engine damage 15% engine destroyed 15% detrack
  #5-0% hitpoints: 75% vehicle destroyed 25% out of control
- Tracked down and fixed the remaining situations where the 5% health bug would appear.
- Removed the Population Upkeep threshold for all nations, this value removed the upkeep of x amount of entities.
- Panzerfaust base damage decreased from 275 to 200 and target tables fixed. The General performance versus vehicles should be like this:
 *26% of a Sherman/Cromwell
 *33% of a M10/M18/M36
 *18% of a Pershing
 *22% of a Churchill
 *44% of a Stuart
 *61%/41% of a M8/T17/Staghound
 *53% of a M3 Halftrack
 *86% of a Bren Carrier
- The last member of any decrewed team weapon that can reinforce will now be killed. This is done to prevent team weapon duplicating exploit.
- Significantly improved the effectiveness of Anti-Aircraft Weaponry, they are now much more capable of dealing with incoming aircraft. Multiple of these weapons can now have great air coverage, preventing air strikes from being called in near them.
- Removed permanent 0.75 accuracy decrease due to how cover works from all vehicles.
- Improved the way green cover works with vehicles.
- Decreased the time which infantry units need to go out of combat stance from 7 to 5 seconds.

- Normalized tank gun damage multipliers versus buildings and HQ trucks.
- Grenades-type abilities can no longer be used while inside Halftracks.
- All bridge hitpoints increased from 300 to 900.

- New reward unit: King Tiger (Porsche Turret) - A King Tiger with the Porsche turret. This variant comes with a turret mounted MG42 Light Machine Gun instead of the Tank Commander, thus fielding much better anti-infantry capabilities but as a trade-off less view range and camouflage detection capabilities.
- 50mm Pak38 Anti-Tank Gun substituted for the more powerful 75mm Pak 40 Anti-Tank Gun. The Pak40 performs like the Marder or Geschützwagen in terms of firepower, but compared to the Pak38 it also is more sluggish and fires slower. The design choice for this is that the 50mm Pak 38 never was designed to deal with heavier allied tanks, making it difficult to balance from a historical point of view.

AI:
- Significantly improved and switched around much of the unit purchase logic.
- Overhauled much of Attack and Defend targets logic. Key new features include:
 * Additional logic for moving units to corners of the map which weren't usually considered by the AI. This affects maps like Wolfheze most of all
 * Improved AI spreading out across the map overall.
 * Significantly improved AIs rushing to the middle of the map at the beginning of the game.
 * Fixed an issue where AI would be too hesitant to advance onto enemy positions. This also massively improves the issue of it getting stuck on bridges.
 * Fixed AI for maps where HQ are closer together than normal (like Etavaux).
 * Further improved frontline forming and enemy encirclement by the AI.
 * AI is now more likely to defend areas with its attacking units, making it not leave any holes in its frontline and also resulting in fewer unit clumps when attacking.
 * AI will now consider targets distance from both friendly HQs instead of just its own.
 * AI will now respond to threats near its base and in friendly territory much better.
 * Improved defensive building placement.
 * Introduced a balanced randomness element to how AI chooses its attack and defend targets which gets reset periodically to a new value, ensuring that AI will try new approaches rather than trying same strategies over and over. This also helps plug any holes in the overall targets logic.
 * Improved performance: added caching of values that are reused throughout the game, capped the total amount of points that get processed per update.
- AI will no longer idle for a number of seconds at the beginning of the game, it is initialized almost instantly.
- Significantly reduced instances where AI would get stuck and not do anything due to map types or topology.
- Fixed an issue which caused AI to get stuck on and around bridges or some map areas.
- Made crucial improvements and fixes to AI capture logic:
 * No more capturing under fire.
 * Can now capture non-connected territory if it wants to.
 * Significantly reduced instances of the endless move-capture orders bug.
- Difficulty settings adjusted and the resource bonuses have been reworked.

 * Mobile artillery and mortars will now be forced to keep their distance from the enemy.
 * Team weapons will now move back properly if they think they're in danger.
 * Team weapons will now quickly retreat if the threat of the enemy close by is high enough.
 * Team weapons will now rotate to fire at the enemy if they see a better target than they're facing at more often. This also fixes MGs facing at wrong direction and not trying to rotate.
 * Across the board improvements in the different settings for all the team weapons.
 * Redone most of the British HQ setup logic, improving performance and reducing bugs.
 * Retreat is now handled through this file, retreat rules updated significantly.
 * AT guns now have a completely different way to set up, only staying in the fight if they're fighting vehicles and retreating from infantry.
 * Added a new behavior for units which makes them attack move towards the enemy at opportune moments rather than just seek cover and set up towards them. This is used for making snipers as deadly as possible.
 * The way units seek retreat and setup direction is redone completely, taking friendly units into account and choosing setup direction more intelligently.
 * Team weapons should no longer needlessly resetup right when the enemy enters their vicinity.
 * The script will now slow down based on the number of units it needs to operate on. This significantly improves lategame performance.
 * Significantly improved the way AI chooses artillery clump targets.
 * Bypassed a weird scar error which would occur after certain campaign missions.
- Added a brand new vehicle control script:
 * Vehicles will now be forced to face the enemy properly.
 * Vehicles will now retreat from danger properly.
 * Vehicles will now move back to the HQ or to closest safe point when low on health or when they have critical damage.
 * There are special rules for certain vehicles, altering their behavior based on the type of behavior you would expect from them (for example, sherman crocodile will start to keep its distance much later than normal unless there's enemy armor in its vicinity).
- To go along with the new vehicle script, important improvements were made to repair unit purchase logic, increasing the number of pioneers and engineers AI builds proportionally to the number of friendly vehicles on the field.
- Added weights to AI command tree choices - slightly improves randomness but also adds weights which make AI choose the trees more suitable for it slightly more often.
- AI will no longer use follow on squads with team weapons.
- Altered AI VP importance logic:
 * Made AI more frantic about capturing victory points if it's about to lose, regardless of how many points the enemy has.
 * AI should start paying attention to its victory points much sooner in the game.
 * Significantly increased AI victory point importance increase on low victory point count.
 * Victory point importance logic now reflects how many victory points AI needs to not bleed victory points. It should be much more aggressive if it has less points than it needs to stay even, and should play as usual when it's not bleeding points, or is bleeding the enemy.
 * Changed the way the victory point importance accumulates due to AI having less victory points than the enemy.
- Significantly improved weapon pick up logic.
- Significantly improved team weapon capture logic.
- Fixed one more possibility where AI could end up turning the 3rd level production on and off endlessly.
- Decreased AI basic infantry building priority when it's close to popcap.
- Retreat is now handled through a separate script, considering surrounding danger and strength of friendlies much better as well as retreating from buildings properly.

- Further improvements made to how AI uses unit abilities. Biggest changes include:
 * Grenades have had additional demand logic added so that they aren't thrown every time AI gets a target.
 * Repair changes - pioneers and engineers will find repair targets on larger distances (this helps repair bridges and idle tanks that will be around due to new aicontrol script), PE infantry had its repair radius and priority reduced to prevent mass repairs that tended to happen too often.
- AI will sometimes buy flamethrowers on engineers and pioneers again. The demand function was not working correctly.
- Improved the way AI takes cover.
- Improved the way PE AI buys upgrades and techs up.
- Improved airborne and all glider drop locations.
- Improved airborne supply drop logic.

American:
- Fixed a bug where the M4 'Assault' Sherman could not target Bunkers and other Structures.
- Turret M2hb .50cal HMGs weapon tables fixed. This is a flat nerf for the weapon, as it had a way too high DPS at all ranges.

- Decreased Assault Sherman priority
- Decreased Fuel bonuses
- Increased Munition bonuses to match manpower bonuses

- Artillery and Airstrike warnings redesigned and overhauled. Instead of dropped red smoke, there will be a yellow ring visible for 5 seconds to show where the barrage or airstrike is triggered. The idea behind this change is to fix the well known bug which sometimes won't show the smoke FX for players.

Languages:
- Improved descriptions for all Officer type units.
- Improved descriptions of all units available, to show up-to-date and more detailed information.
- Improved descriptions of all base buildings, to show correct information on what they contain.

- AI now handles unit priority from fuel/manpower ratio calculations differently. This majorly improves its spending and almost completely prevents it from floating resources.
- AI Resource bonuses have been redistributed:
  * Expert AI now has even more resource bonuses.
  * Hard AI now has almost same resources as Expert AI had previously.
  * Normal AI has more resources (between old Normal and Hard).

  * British HQ behavior seems to be in its sweet spot now.
  * Significantly improved HMG behavior.
- Improved Panzer Elite building purchase logic.
- Slightly improved AI taking cover logic.
- Reworked AI Victory Point priorities. Victory Point win condition was outright broken before, now fixed and working as intended.
- Added a special retreating rule for when AI is reaching its population cap. This is supposed to address the issue of it having too many squads, which in term causes it to not be able to reinforce all/any of them and ultimately camp all of them in its base.
- Improved AI threat detection for capture points - should capture under fire much less frequently.
- Rewrote command tree random choices ensuring it works properly and more efficiently (didn't seem to do what it was supposed to do at all).

  * Fixed a lot of spline displacement profiles.
  * Fixed a lot of ambiguity in map pathfinding.
  * Added cover to middle and bottom parts of the map.
  * Widened the middle passage in a way which will make it more difficult to cover it with a single MG and that allows additional flanking to the bottom of the map possibilities.

  * Slightly increased the radius inside which the barn cinematic triggers
- M03 Carentan:
  * Fixed AT gun retreating bug.
- M04 Carentan Counterattack:
  * Fixed mission ending prematurely due to the final condition being for destroying all StuGs and the map spawning only Marders - now checks for both types.

Global balance changes:
- General continuous improvements and balancing of the weapon and combat mechanics.
- Reiteration of Infantry combat system. Quite drastic changes to wehrmacht weapon damage models.
- Redesigned Mine Area of Effect damage and Target Tables, mines are now very likely to damage or destroy the engine or tracks on Medium and Heavy Vehicles with minimal damage, but deal medium to high damage and/or suppression towards Light Vehicles and Infantry. This makes mines how they were intended, to protect flanks, emplacements and cripple enemy advances.
- Mines now have a 35% chance of blowing up the wheels of Halftracks and Armored Cars.
- Equalized movement capabilities of all Sherman based vehicles (M4 Sherman, 'Crocodile', 'Easy Eight', 'Assault', Firefly, M7 Priest and Kangaroo).

- Panzer 38(t) based vehicles chassis movement parameters equalized.
- Redesigned and fixed weapon tables of Turret, Coaxial and Hull Machine Guns mounted on vehicles, to be more in line with the Light Machine Gun Counterparts:
  *Coaxial and hull MG42 Light Machine Guns on Axis vehicles deal half the DPS as the regular MG42 Light Machine Gun, with the range of Sub Machine Guns/Assault Rifles.
  *Turret MG42 Light Machine Guns on Axis vehicles deal equal DPS as the regular MG42 Light Machine Gun with equal range.
  *MG42 Light Machine Guns mounted on the Motorcycle and Schwimmwagen deals equal DPS as the regular MG42 Light Machine Gun with equal range, but does not suffer from accuracy penalties on the move.
  *MG42 Light Machine Guns mounted on Axis Halftracks and Armored Cars are now equal to the regular MG42 Light Machine Gun.
  *Coaxial and hull M1919a4/Besa Light Machine Guns mounted on Allied Tanks deals similar damage to that of the coaxial/hull MG42 Light Machine Gun, but is slightly better on long and worse on close range.

- Horizontal traverse speed of Anti-Tank Guns decreased. This change isn't highly notable, but should slightly increase the survivability of light vehicles.
- Fixed some huge inconsistencies between different 20mm Flakvierling weapons. The Flakvierlings that the player will face in singleplayer missions will no longer obliterate anything that comes near them.
- Redesigned Assault ability (for both Wehrmacht and American); The squad will now throw 1-2 grenades at the targeted unit and receives some good defensive modifiers, to help pushing into the enemy.
- Assault ability munition costs decreased from 50 to 35.
- Crews of emplaced weapons will now properly take damage in combat, making it much easier to break through emplacements, as the crew will die much faster than the emplacement does. This changes emplacement combat dramatically, as it will no longer require to completely destroy emplacements in order to disable them.
- Grenades will now properly be thrown into emplacements, having high chances to kill crew members.
- Dropzone scatter radius of paradrop abilities decreased from 30 to 10.
- Tidied and fixed all veterancy points given when a unit dies or is destroyed; veterancy should now be received more equally across the four nations.

- New unit: M18 Hellcat, buildable after Advanced Tank Destroyers is unlocked. It is a highly mobile tank destroyer that comes equipped with a powerful 76mm Anti-Tank Gun. Due to the use of HVAP ammunition, the gun has a higher chance to penetrate axis heavy tanks frontally than the M10 Wolverine has (the difference in global penetration is 0.01). It can be upgraded with a M2Hb .50cal HMG to deal with Infantry.
- Removed M7 Priest from Infantry Company, thus removing the M7 Priest completely from the Americans.

AI:

* Finally bridged the gap between AI and ScAR.
  We're extremely happy and excited about this, as this particular thing allows custom control of any unit we want. This used to cause sync errors in multiplayer, but now it works. As far as our knowledge goes, Back to Basics is the only mod at the moment which is doing this. The only problem with adding new units to control is that it takes a lot of effort to properly program their behavior. Currently, there are two types of branches this script has for controlling two different types of units:
- British HQ trucks. Vanilla HQs weren't very smart at all and could break AIs behavior completely. This frustrating aspect of AI which left us out of modding British AI out of utter frustration with it is now finally fixed. And it's fixed pretty well - HQs will move away if they're under threat and they will setup on high income points properly.
- Units which are meant to engage at range (and setup the weapon). Weapons like HMGs, mortars and tanks like marders won't suicide nearly as much anymore and setup in position properly, retreat from threats.
* We've modified all of 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 maps to make AI much smarter on them.
  We've added around 60-90 markers per map which allows AI to properly evaluate the situation and even set up defenses there (as opposed to only being able to setup defenses near strategic points).
* Drastically improved the targets.ai file.
  This file is responsible for how AI chooses all kinds of its targets - what it attacks, captures and defends. Changes include:
- Much earlier pushes in the beginning of the game.
- AI will try to secure the middle of the map properly.
- Almost never will you see random stray units behind your lines anymore, especially not running into your base MGs.
- Not nearly as many suicides for defensive units like nebelwerfers and other mobile artillery (this however still remains to be fixed by the ScAR script which I've talked about above as it's impossible to fully control it otherwise).
- AI will capture strategic points under fire much less frequently.
- AI capture patterns are drastically improved.
* Drastically improved the attack percentage evaluation.
  This is also highly connected such calculations with targets.ai file. AI will become much more cautious in certain situations and generally feel more like a human player.
- It will stop being crazily aggressive if it knows it has less units than the player.
- It will become slightly less aggressive as it captures more territory. This fixes problems of it losing too many units before being able to kill the player (It will wait for bigger amounts of units to break the opponents while still constantly bombarding the positions and securing the territory around the enemy positions).
- Early in the game this metric is modified to make AI attack more than it usually would, thus being more aggressive towards creating its initial front line.
* A lot of ability usage fixes.
  AI will use abilities like grenades, marksman shot, assault, and satchel charges much better and target them on things that the abilities are most effective against.
* Fixed a bug where AI would keep spamming artillery on strategic points.
  Apparently Relic thought that strategic points are tp_infantry so AI thought that strategic points were in fact infantry who stood still all game long, thus are best for bombarding.
* Balanced munitions usage properly.
  AI will rarely float a lot of munitions, however it will still save some for player abilities (off-map artillery) when it needs to.
* Balanced fuel/manpower unit purchases properly
  The economy of AI is dependant on the actual fuel/manpower ratio, preventing the floating of these resources. It's not directly influenced by this, however - other rules are more important and this is only a wildcard which fixes the inaccuracies.
* Fixed unit reinforcing bug where AI would have a lot of units waiting to be reinforced at home.
  This bug was caused by a different number of reasons - from being popcapped to waiting for a more expensive unit to buy.
* Drastically improved unit retreat.
  Relic's retreat rules were ridiculously simple. We had to come up with a bit of a tricky fix for this and added much more rules for retreating.
* Fixed lieutenant, sergeant, medic and other leader AI.
  These units will no longer sit in buildings all game long, suicide by trying to follow a unit which is all the way across the map or simply not retreating when close to enemy (this is still not 100% fixed but works much better).
* Completely fixed unit call-ins.
  They were already mostly fixed in 1.2. However we used a special script to control that. For some reason tank call-ins still used to bug out and AI would simply keep calling them in endlessly as soon as it got the resources which made it spam units like Geschutzwagen horribly. Now we're not using the script anymore, we found another way to fix it and now it works properly in all cases and this also slightly improved game performance. Added and improved the rules and priorities for all the call-ins.
* AI will use cover better
  Slightly improved the cover search tactic function.
* AI will stay in buildings longer and more properly, enter them much more often.
  Heavily improved building entering priority evaluation tactic rules.
